# Web Based Client Application

## Overview
- This project aims to create a Web-based client application that interacts with a data exchange REST Web service. The client application will consist of a set of web pages designed to enable end users to seamlessly interact with the resources exposed by the Web service.

- The primary objective of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to consume and utilize the functionalities provided by the Web service. By leveraging the client application, users will be able to perform various actions and retrieve data from the Web service in a convenient and efficient manner.

## Tech Stack
1. Vanilla JavaScript
2. Bootstrap 5
3. FetchApi

## Key Features:

- Web-based client application: The project involves developing a set of web pages that serve as the front-end interface for interacting with the Web service.
- Data exchange: The client application will consume the REST Web service [films-api][1] enabling users to exchange data with the service.
- Resource interaction: Users will be able to interact with the resources exposed by the Web service through the client application, such as retrieving, and creating data.
- User-friendly interface: The web pages will be designed with a focus on usability and intuitiveness, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable user experience.
- Error Handling: The client application is equipped with robust error handling capabilities to ensure a smooth user experience. It includes comprehensive client-side error handling mechanisms that effectively capture and handle errors encountered during user interactions
- By combining the Web service and client application, this project aims to create a comprehensive solution for data exchange, where users can seamlessly interact with the Web service's resources through an intuitive web interface. This project will facilitate effective data management and utilization for end users.
